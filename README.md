# CSCI-Final-Project-1
A github of my progress work on Project 1

main_window.py is the main function. I was unable to get a controller and thus a "main" python file to work for this

voting_window.py is the voting window GUI, it doesn't really do anything, I added some code to attempt to make the john and jane votes go up when the buttons are selected

results_window.py is the window that opens as a results and when "exit" is selected from the main screen. I would have needed to import the john and jane variables for this and use those to set the results labels, but since I didn't get that to work I had to leave them as a default to show how my codes worked together

Code I added: code linking the buttons together to get the windows to work off of each other and I designed the GUIs. I realize this code is a shell of what it should be but I ran out of time due to other projects.
